# Mimibox
### Problem statement
*[Halberdier](https://github.com/a-n-d-r-3-w/halberdier)* is a local (offline) password manager for Mac based on ElectronJS. The functionality is small in scope, yet the packaged .APP file is larger than 100 MB, and unless I pay Apple $100 every year to distribute the app via their app store, Mac users see an "unidentified developer" warning when trying to launch the app.

### Solution
*Mimibox* is an offline password manager for Chrome that is about 1 MB and easily installed and launched without the "unidentified developer" warning.
